Roadmap
=======

Since :mod:`BioSimSpace` aims to be interoperable across the molecular simulation
engines that we support, new features can often take some time to fully implement
and test. We have recently created a ref:`Sandpit <ref-Sandpit>` area, which allows
early access to and testing of expermintal features, often provided by external
collaborators. Over time we work to port these features into the main code base.

New features that we aim to implement over the coming year are:

* Consistent cross-package alchemical free-energy analysis using
  `alchemlyb <https://alchemlyb.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`__.
  Analysis is currently performed by engine-specific tools, making it hard
  to make direct comparisons between results generated by different engines.
* Support for relative binding free-energy simulations with AMBER. (This is
  already implemented in ``BioSimSpace.Sandpit.Exscientia`` and will be ported
  to the main code base.)
* Support for absolute binding free-energy simulations with GROMACS and SOMD.
  (Initial support already exists in ``BioSimSpace.Sandpit.Exscientia``.)
* Implementation of a translation layer to provide (where possible) direct
  interconversion between common molecular system representations, e.g.
  `OpenMM <https://openmm.org>`__, `Open Force Field <https://openforcefield.org>`__,
  and `RDKit <https://www.rdkit.org>`__. This will avoid the need for translation
  via intermediate molecular files, which are unavoidably lossy in nature.

If you would like to suggest features that should be
added to the roadmap then please
`raise a feature request here <https://github.com/openbiosim/biosimspace/issues/new?assignees=lohedges&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE+REQUEST%5D+-+I%27d+like+BioSimSpace+to>`_.

More details about individual feature branches, which contain the new
features being actively worked on, is available on the
`GitHub issues <https://github.com/openbiosim/biosimspace/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afeature-branch>`_
