# BioSimSpace dynamically generates function names for force fields from the
# Open Force Field initiative. As such, we can't hard-code these into the
# Sphinx docstrings within the BioSimSpace.Parameters __init__ file. Here
# we use a Python script to capture the names of the functions, then inject
# them into the __init__ file using sed.

# Query the force fields that are supported in this build and capture the output.
force_fields=$($HOME/sire.app/bin/python $HOME/BioSimSpace/docker/document-devel/supported_force_fields.py)

# Inject the string into the __init__ of the BioSimSpace.Parameters package.
# We use the source repository since the sire.app installation of BioSimSpace
# is zipped, i.e. an egg file.
# This is only run on Linux so the following, non-portable, sed command is fine.
sed -i "s/__FORCE_FIELDS__/$force_fields/g" $HOME/BioSimSpace/python/BioSimSpace/Parameters/__init__.py
